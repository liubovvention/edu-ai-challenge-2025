New task. We need to start new application:

	•	Social platform with millions of users
	•	Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
	•	High data read speed required
	•	Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
	•	Scalability is important as the user base grows

Let’s analyse  this set of requirements and think about the most suitable type of database we need for this project
