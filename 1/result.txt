Great — let's break down the requirements and map them to database types that suit each need. Then we can identify the best overall approach for your social platform.

1. Requirement Breakdown & Analysis
A. Social Platform with Millions of Users
	•	Implication: High volume of concurrent users and data.
	•	Need: Scalability, distributed architecture, and fast access patterns.
B. Store Profiles, Posts, and Connections
	•	Data Types:
	◦	Profiles: Structured data (user info, settings).
	◦	Posts: Semi-structured, time-series-like.
	◦	Connections: Graph-like (friend/follow relationships).
	•	Need: Flexible data modeling, ability to handle relationships.
C. High Read Speed
	•	Implication: Fast queries, caching layers, possible denormalization.
	•	Need: Low-latency data access for things like feeds, profiles.
D. 80% Reads / 20% Writes
	•	Implication: Optimized for reads; write throughput is important but secondary.
	•	Need: Indexing, read replicas, caching strategies.
E. Scalability
	•	Implication: Horizontal scaling is key.
	•	Need: Distributed databases with sharding or partitioning support.

2. Database Types and Evaluation
Database Type, Pros, Cons, Fit for This Use Case

Relational (SQL)
Strong consistency, mature tools, good for structured data
Less scalable for huge user bases, harder to model connections
Good for profiles and posts but not optimal for scaling or social graph

NoSQL - Document (e.g., MongoDB)
Schema flexibility, good read performance, horizontal scaling
Not ideal for highly relational data (like user connections)
Great for profiles and posts

NoSQL - Wide-column (e.g., Cassandra)
Very high read/write performance, great scalability
Harder to model relationships, complex queries limited
Great for posts/feed retrieval

NoSQL - Graph DB (e.g., Neo4j)
Excellent for modeling connections, relationships
Not great for large-scale general data or high write throughput
Best for friend/follow graph

Hybrid Approach
Pick best DB for each use case
More operational complexity
Ideal solution for large systems

3. Recommended Architecture (Hybrid)
Given your requirements, the best strategy is a polyglot persistence architecture — using different databases for different needs:
A. Document Store (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase)
	•	Use for: User profiles, posts, comments
	•	Why: Flexible schemas, fast reads, good for hierarchical/nested data
	•	Scale: Easily sharded across many nodes
B. Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune)
	•	Use for: User connections, social graph traversal
	•	Why: Queries like mutual friends, suggested connections are fast and intuitive
	•	Scale: Modern graph DBs can scale with partitioning
C. Caching Layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
	•	Use for: Feeds, hot data, session data
	•	Why: Low-latency, in-memory access for frequently read data
D. Analytics Layer (Optional)
	•	Use: BigQuery, ClickHouse, or Redshift
	•	For: Analytics on posts, engagement, trends

4. Summary Recommendation
Component, Database, Purpose

Profiles & Posts
MongoDB
High read speed, flexible structure

User Connections
Neo4j
Efficient graph traversal

Feed Caching
Redis
Fast reads, in-memory caching

Analytics
ClickHouse / BigQuery
Reporting and analytics at scale
